# Colors of programming languages at GitHub

> Hey!Here is a go version of [github-colors](https://github.com/ozh/github-colors).

This was inspired by [doda/github-language-colors](https://github.com/doda/github-language-colors) which is (was? I think it's dead) a manually edited list. The thing is, their list is incomplete and sometimes colors change.

The script, `github-colors.go`, checks [Github](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) for the list of all languages, saves all colors in `colors.json` and updates the `README.md`
